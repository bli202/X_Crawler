Sentences for Key Elements:

The key element 'claimed' in this context refers to the customers stating that they have successfully redeemed or claimed a particular offer or reward. In this case, it seems to be related to a game called #TravelFrog where customers are claiming 2000 diamonds worth $20. However, there seems to be an issue as many customers are complaining about not receiving the claimed reward in their email or mailbox. Some are also questioning the value of the reward, as they believe it will be erased when the game officially launches.

In this context, 'code' refers to a unique sequence of numbers, letters, or symbols that customers receive via email. This code is likely a redemption code or voucher that customers can use to claim a reward, discount, or special offer. In this case, it seems the reward is related to a game called TravelFrog, where the code might be used to claim in-game currency or items. The customers are discussing their experiences of receiving, or not receiving, this code in their email. Some are also discussing what happens after redeeming the code and the implications of the game's launch on their claimed rewards.

The key element 'received' in this context refers to the customers' experiences with receiving something, likely a product, service, or some form of communication, from the company. In this case, it seems like the customers are discussing a game, possibly an online or mobile game, and they are talking about whether or not they have received certain items or rewards in the game, such as a redemption code, an email, or a 'diamond airdrop'. Some customers are expressing frustration or confusion because they have not yet received these items, while others are thanking the company for what they have received.
